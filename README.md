## Files

* The data was downloaded from [UCI HAR DATASET](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and un-zipped.

* **CodeBook.md** describes the variables and any modifications done to tidy the data.

* **run_analysis.R** contains all the code to perform the functions asked in the project. Download the R-script in the same folder as the dataset. Set the working directory to the folder that has the un-zipped data and the R-Script. Then run the script in R-Studio. The code takes the data that is present in the same folder, un-compressed.

* Finally, tidy average of each variable is stored in a file called **tidy_mergedData.txt**, and uploaded in the course project's repo.

## Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
